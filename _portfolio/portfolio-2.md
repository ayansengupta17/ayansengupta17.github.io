In this project, an algorithm which solves the multi-agent consensus tracking problem for one leader and multiple followers is implemented on a testbed of four quadrotors in an indoor environment. The leader agent generates a reference trajectory autonomously for the pursuer agents to track. The feedback control law guarantees that the group of followers converge on to the trajectory of the evader in shortest possible time.

This is a work-in-progress. Details to come soon!
