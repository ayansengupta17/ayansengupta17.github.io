## So far so good, but still a long way to go !

Hello readers. It is a pleasure that you are viewing my blog. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) helped me set up this blog. I am still learning how to create and configure stuffs using Jekyll. The documentaion is pretty neat and well written. If you like the outlook of this static page, and you want to create a blog like this, follow the links I mentioned above. If you still face problems, contact me, maybe I can help you to set it up initially.

The blog is in its embryonic stage. Within next weekend I hope I will manage to set up all the links, and pages in working mode. Officially I will launch it on 17 July, 2017. I will be glad to recieve any suggestions.

You should definitely check out the blog of [Michael](https://mademistakes.com/)
