* Designed the website of [Control and Computing](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~ccgroup/), Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay.
* Conducted Basic Python Workshop in IIT Bombay, 2019. Files: [workshop ipython files](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/PythonWorkshop)
* A simple script for instant notification on ubuntu and your android mobile. I used it for placement notifications. [Link](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/PlacementNotifierIITB)
* [Google Scholar Parser](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GoogleScholarParser): A simple Python script to parse Authors name, year, and publication list and create a markdown file for each author.
* [Upgrading all packages with pip](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/Upgrading-all-packages-with-pip): A small python script that will upgrade all the pip packages at once. Unlike pip freeze, this will not print warnings and fixme errors.
Moreover, being a python script, this method works on both Linux and Windows. You need to run it as root if you're on MacOs.
* [Auto Login Script](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/Auto_login-V0.1) : This is a small code snippet, for automatic login in to *internet.iitb.ac.in* for guys staying in IIT Bombay. This code can be modified and used for any such logins.
