excerpt: "About me"
---

I am currently working in the Global Innovation Unit of NEC
Corporation, Japan as an AI researcher. I am responsible for extending
the boundaries of research in the field of **Automated Negotiation**.
My work falls under the intersection of domains of Automated
Negotiation, Reinforcement learning and Deep Learning. Moreover, Iâ€™m also member of the group
of experts of United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business ([UN/CEFACT](https://unece.org/trade/uncefact)).
I actively participate in the public debate for the disclosure and sustainable development of technology.

Previously I worked as Research Assistant in Control and Computing lab in IIT Bombay.
I majorly worked on novel algebraic solvers for solving boundary control problem of real
world applications governed by partial differential equations. During that time, I also
 completed my Masters in Control and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I am
passionate about bringing machine learning to a practical level where it is
a product that solves problem for people.

My major interests are in the domain of data science, machine
learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning.
