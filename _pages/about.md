excerpt: "About me"
---

I am currently pursuing my Masters in Control and Computing from Indian
Institute of Technology, Bombay. I graduated from Indian Institute of
Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Shibpur (formerly known as Bengal
Engineering and Science University, Shibpur). My passion is to bring machine learning to a practical level where it is a product that solves problem for people.
My major interests are in the domain of data science, machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning. However, currently I am working on two projects which are not in the field of machine learning
, one being *Fast Computation of exact solution of partial differential equations* while the other one is *Boundary control of Infinite Dimensional Systems*.
I have also worked on some other projects, which involves deep learning, Arduino, python, swift programming language, etc.
For other projects check out my [GitHub]("https://github.com/ayansengupta17/") page.

Moreover, I love to learn new skills. In less than 24 months, Iâ€™ve learned the following:
1. **How to use Adobe InDesign.** Now I can create and publish magazines/newsletter using Adobe InDesign. I designed the Department Newsletter of Electrical Engineering department. Check out the newsletter below:
[Background Hum 2017]("https://issuu.com/ayansengupta17/docs/bh_final")
2. **How to use SageMath.** SageMath is a free open-source mathematics software system. It is built on top of many existing open-source packages such as  NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, SymPy, Maxima, GAP, FLINT, R and many more.
3. **How to solve Rubik's cube.** I won't claim that I learned it just by myself in a random weekend. Actually, I learned to solve Rubik's cube from YouTube videos. I am not a speedcuber, not even close, but yes I can solve it!
4. **How to solve Magic cube.** The intuitions and methods are the same as a normal Rubik's cube, but it requires a bit of practice.

Apart from these, I love playing FIFA and other online multiplayer games including Counter-Strike.<br/>
PS: I am a great fan of the Harry Potter series.
