excerpt: "About me"
---

I am currently working in the Global Innovation Unit of NEC
Corporation, Japan as an AI researcher. I am responsible for extending
the boundaries of research in the field of **Automated Negotiation**.
My work falls under the intersection of domains of Automated
Negotiation, Reinforcement learning and Deep Learning. Moreover, Iâ€™m also member of the group
of experts of United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business ([UN/CEFACT](https://unece.org/trade/uncefact)).
I actively participate in the public debate for the disclosure and sustainable development of technology.

Previously I worked as Research Assistant in Control and Computing lab in IIT Bombay.
I majorly worked on novel algebraic solvers for solving boundary control problem of real
world applications governed by partial differential equations. During that time, I also
 completed my Masters in Control and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

My major interests are in the domain of data science, machine
learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning.  I am
passionate about bringing machine learning to a practical level where it is
a product that solves problem for people.
