excerpt: "About me"
---

I am currently working in Data Science Laboraty, NEC Japan as a researcher. I am responsible for extending the boundaries of research in the field of **Automated Negotiation**. My work falls under the intersection of domains of Automated Negotiation, Reinforcement learning and Machine Learning.

I completed my Masters in Control and Computing from Electrical Engineering Department of Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. My passion is to bring machine learning to a practical level where it is a product that solves problem for people.

My major interests are in the domain of data science, machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning.
