excerpt: "About me"
---

I am currently working in the Global Innovation Unit of NEC
Corporation, Japan as an AI researcher. I am responsible for extending
the boundaries of research in the field of **Automated Negotiation**.
My work falls under the intersection of domains of Automated
Negotiation, Reinforcement learning and Deep Learning.

Previously I worked as Research Assistant in Control and Computing lab in IIT Bombay.
I majorly worked on novel algebraic solvers for solving boundary control problem of real
world applications governed by partial differential equations.
I completed my Masters in Control and Computing from Electrical
Engineering Department of Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. My
passion is to bring machine learning to a practical level where it is
a product that solves problem for people.

My major interests are in the domain of data science, machine
learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning.
