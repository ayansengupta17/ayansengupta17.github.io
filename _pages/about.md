2024 - Present
--------
Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at [MyImmune](https://www.myimmune.ai/), where we harness Artificial Intelligence to revolutionize liquid biopsy technology, driving precision in medical diagnostics. MyImmune’s AI-powered platform leverages adaptive immune networks to decode the immune system, transforming biological data into actionable insights that accelerate diagnostics and therapeutic discovery.

To know more about our work, check out the following publications:
- [Robust detection of infectious disease, autoimmunity, and cancer from the paratope networks of adaptive immune receptors](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/25/5/bbae431/7748265?login=false)
- [Deciphering the antigen specificities of antibodies by clustering their complementarity determining region sequences](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00722-23)


2023-2024
---------
I contributed to an AI startup, [Incubit](https://www.incubit.co.jp/) in Tokyo focused on enhancing productivity through innovative AI solutions. I led the development of [Tektome](https://tektome.com/), an LLM-driven architectural design tool that transforms raw design data from BIM, CAD, and architectural diagrams into structured, actionable insights. By automating and refining data pipelines, Tektome empowers architects and designers with a robust, tailored database for streamlined workflows.


2022 - 2023
--------------
I was part of the Machine Learning team at an AI startup [Cogent Labs](https://www.cogent.co.jp/en/), whose primary goal is to power productivity with Artificial Intelligence. Cogent Labs has been in the list of <strong>LinkedIn Top Startups 2021</strong> for the three consecutive years. My work was majorly focused in one of our top products called [SmartRead](https://smartread.jp/).

To get a brief idea on our product, have a glance at the following video:

2019 - 2022
------------
I was working in the Global Innovation Unit of NEC Corporation, Japan as an AI researcher.
 I was responsible for extending the boundaries of research in the field of Automated Negotiation.
  My work fell under the intersection of domains of Automated Negotiation, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Learning.

 Moreover, I’m also a member of the group of experts of the United Nations Centre for
Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business ([UN/CEFACT](https://unece.org/trade/uncefact)). I actively participate in the public debate
for the disclosure and sustainable development of technology.

2016 - 2019
-----------
Previously I worked as Research Assistant in Control and Computing lab in IIT Bombay.
I majorly worked on novel algebraic solvers for solving boundary control problems of real-world applications governed by
partial differential equations. During that time, I also completed my Masters in Control and Computing from the Indian Institute
of Technology Bombay.My major interests are in the domain of data science, machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.
