title: "$whoami"
excerpt: "About me"
---

Currently, I am pursuing my Masters in Control and computing from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I completed my B.Tech from Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Shibpur (formerly known as Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur).
My current project is "Fast Computation of exact solution of partial differential equations". Mainly the project has two parts, a theoretical aspect, and an implementation part.  Till now, my contribution has been in the latter part. I worked on some other projects, requiring skills from arduino, python to swift programming language. For other projects check out my [GitHub]("https://github.com/ayansengupta17/")

Moreover, I love to learn new skills. In less than 24 months, Iâ€™ve learned the following:
1. **How to code in Python.** All the codes I write for my project are mainly based on Python. I keep on using it, and always get something new to learn.
2. **How to use Adobe InDesign.** Now I can create and publish magazines/newsletter using InDesign. I was working on our departmental newsletter, and finally it is done. Check out the newsletter below:
[Background Hum 2017]("https://issuu.com/ayansengupta17/docs/bh_final")
3. **How to use SageMath.** SageMath is a free open-source mathematics software system. It is built on top of many existing open-source packages: NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Sympy, Maxima, GAP, FLINT, R and many more.
4. **How to solve Rubik's cube.** I won't claim I learnt it just by myself in a random weekend. Actually, I learned to solve Rubik's cube from YouTube videos. I am not a speed cuber, not even close, but yes I can solve it!
5. **How to solve Magic cube.** The intuitions and methods are same as a normal Rubik's cube, but it requires a bit of practice.

Apart from these, I love playing FIFA and other online multiplayer games like Counter-Strike.
PS: I am a great fan of Harry Potter series.
