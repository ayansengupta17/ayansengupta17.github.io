Interest
------
My passion is to bring machine learning to a practical level where it is a product that solves problem for people.
My major interests are in the domain of data science, machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning.

Experience
------
**Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay**
Final Year Student (May 2018 – Present)
* Boundary Control of Infinite Dimensional Systems
    * Involves boundary control of systems represented by partial differential equation(s).
    * Involves algebraic analysis of motion planning of systems governed by partial differential equations.
    * Proposed algorithmic way of solving motion planning problems for infinite dimensional systems.

**Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay**
Research Assistant (Aug 2016 – Present)

* Algorithms for Fast Computation of Exact Solution of Partial Differential Equation(s)
    * Implemented an algebraic solver for partial differential equations using Oberst-Riquier algorithm.
    * Implemented the algorithms for Characteristic Cones given by equation ideal and equation module.
