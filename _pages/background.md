Interest
------
My passion is to bring machine learning to a practical level where it is a product that solves challenging problem for people.
My major interests are in the domain of machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning and control systems.

Current Projects
------
Final Year Student in **Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay**
(May 2018 – Present)

* Boundary Control of Infinite Dimensional Systems
    * Involves boundary control of systems represented by partial differential equation(s).
    * Involves algebraic analysis of motion planning of systems governed by partial differential equations.
    * Proposed algorithmic way of solving motion planning problems for infinite dimensional systems.

Research Assistant at **Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay**
(Aug 2016 – Present)
[Project Page](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~debasattam/ASOP.html)
* Algorithms for Fast Computation of Exact Solution of Partial Differential Equation(s)
    * Implemented an algebraic solver for partial differential equations using Oberst-Riquier algorithm.
    * Implemented the algorithms for Characteristic Cones given by equation ideal and equation module.
    * All the implementations were done in *Python* using open source [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) libraries.
