Interest
------
My passion is to bring machine learning to a practical level where it is a product that solves challenging problem for people.
My major interests are in the domain of machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning and control systems.


Work Experience
------
**NEC Corporation, Japan**
(October 2019 - Present)

* AI Researcher, Global Innovation Unit
    * Designed and implemented a novel Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning based state-of-the-art automated negotiating agent framework with an average performance improvement of 25%. [Papaer](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3463952.3464087)
    * Collaborated with The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Japan (AIST) for research and design of automated negotiation protocols, strategies and value function for various domains.
    * Reviewed and edited Business Requirement Specifications (BRS) and Implementation guidelines of eNegotiation project for The United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) as an expert member.
    * Developed an automated negotiating agent using NegMAS framework for Supply Chain Management League of Automated Negotiating Agents Competition 2020 (ANAC 2020) and secured the 2nd position.



**Indian Institute of Technology Bombay**
(June 2016 â€“ July 2018)

* Research Assistant, Control and Computing Lab
    * Proposed and implemented a novel algebraic solver for solving boundary control problem of real world applications governed by partial differential equations. [Paper](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~debasattam/papers/SIAMPD19_ayan.pdf)
    * Implemented algorithms for checking potential solution spaces of PDEs using Python and SageMath for "Algebraic Solver of PDEs" project funded by Ministry of Science and Technology, India. [Project Page](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~debasattam/ASOP.html)
