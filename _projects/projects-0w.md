**Abstract:**
---------------

With the availability of domain specific historical
negotiation data, the practical applications of machine learning techniques can prove to be increasingly effective
 in the field of automated negotiation.
Yet a large portion of the literature focuses on domain independent negotiation and thus passes the
possibility of leveraging any domain specific insights from historical data. Moreover, during sequential negotiation,
 utility functions may alter due
to various reasons including market demand, partner agreements, weather conditions, etc. This poses
a unique set of challenges and one can easily infer
that one strategy that fts all is rather impossible in
such scenarios. In this work, we present a simple
yet effective method of learning an end-to-end negotiation strategy from historical negotiation data.
Next, we show that transfer learning based solutions are effective in designing adaptive strategies
when underlying utility functions of agents change.
Additionally, we also propose an online method of
detecting and measuring such changes in the utility functions. Combining all three contributions we
propose an adaptive automated negotiating agent
framework that enables the automatic creation of
transfer learning based negotiating agents capable
of adapting to changes in utility functions. Finally,
we present the results of an agent generated using
our framework in different ANAC domains with 88
different utility functions each and show that our
agent outperforms the benchmark score by domain
independent agents by 6%.
