**SCML Introduction:**
---------------

The SCM world simulates a supply chain consisting of multiple factories that buy
and sell products from one another in a simulated market.
The factories are represented by autonomous agents from participants in SCML
that act as factory managers. Each agent decides which other agents to buy and sell from,
and then negotiates with them. The goal is to have the highest median score across all simulations.
The score calculated in SCML is based on a percentage of profit and remnant unsold products.
The simulation proceeds in discrete time steps during which multiple simultaneous negotiations take place.
There are two separate tracks in SCML, 2020: standard track and collusion track. In the standard track,
at most one instantiation of each team’s agent will run in each simulation whereas, in the collusion
track, multiple instantiations of the same team’s agent will run during a single simulation.

**Awards**
--------------------------------
Won 2nd Prize in Collusion League of SCML 2020. It is a part of Automated Negotiating Agents Competition ([ANAC](http://web.tuat.ac.jp/~katfuji/ANAC2020/)).
It was held in International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence ([IJCAI](https://ijcai20.org/)) 2020.
