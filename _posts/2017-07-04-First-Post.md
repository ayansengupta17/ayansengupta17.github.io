## First Post

Hello readers. It is a pleasure that you are viewing my blog. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) helped me set up this blog. I am still learning how to use Jekyll and create and configure stuffs.

The blog is in a very initial stage. Within next weekend I hope I will manage to set up all the links, and pages in working mode. Officially I will launch it on 17 July, 2017. I will be glad to recieve any suggestions.
